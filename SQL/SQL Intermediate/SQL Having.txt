Having Clause is used in place of WHERE clause when setting conditions 
for aggregate functions 

SYNTAX 

SELECT jobtitle, COUNT(jobtitle)
FROM Employeedemographics ed
JOIN
Employeesalary es
ON ed.employeeid=es.employeeid
WHERE  COUNT(jobtitle) > 1
GROUP BY 1

NOTE: This code above will not work except the WHERE CLAUSE is replaced 
with HAVING clause, because where doesnt work with Aggregate functions 

SELECT jobtitle, COUNT(jobtitle)
FROM Employeedemographics ed
JOIN
Employeesalary es
ON ed.employeeid=es.employeeid
HAVING  COUNT(jobtitle) > 1
GROUP BY 1

NOTE: This will note work as well because the HAVING function is completely
dependent on the GROUP BY statement, we are performing it after it's been aggregated. 

SELECT jobtitle, COUNT(jobtitle)
FROM Employeedemographics ed
JOIN
Employeesalary es
ON ed.employeeid=es.employeeid
GROUP BY 1
HAVING  COUNT(jobtitle) > 1

This is the correct syntax while usiog the HAVING CLAUSE.
