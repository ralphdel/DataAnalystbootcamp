PARTITION BY 
Although Partition By and  GROUP BY statements have some similarities , 

GROUP BY reduce the number of rows by rolling them up and then 
 calculating calculating the Average and SUM for each group. 


PARTITION BY divides the result into partition instead, it doesnt reduce 
the number of rows. 

SYNTAX
