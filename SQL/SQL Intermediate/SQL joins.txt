*Inner Joins  
*Full/Left/Right Outer Joins 

A join is a way to combine multiple tables into a single output 

Our tables "Emloyeedemographics" & "Employeesalary" has similar column
>>  EmployeeID 
when you join a table you have to join them on a similar column 

INNER JOIN 

SELECT *  
FROM  Employeedemographics 
INNER JOIN Employeesalary
	ON Employeedemographics.EmployeeID = Employeesalary.EmployeeID

**Notice the inner join or joins only joins table where the two EmployeeID intersects 

If we change the join statement like this

SELECT *  
FROM  Employeedemographics 
FULL OUTER  JOIN Employeesalary
	ON Employeedemographics.EmployeeID = Employeesalary.EmployeeID
All the information on the left and right table will be pulled. 

A LEFT OUTER JOIN PULLS ALL INFORMATION O THE LEFT SIDE OF THE TABLE
regardless if they have matching info on the right table 

SELECT *  
FROM  Employeedemographics 
LEFT JOIN Employeesalary
	ON Employeedemographics.EmployeeID = Employeesalary.EmployeeID

RIGHT JOIN DOES VICE VERSA
