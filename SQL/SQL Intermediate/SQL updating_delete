Udating table 
This used to alter a pre-existing role 

SYNTAX
Example 

UPDATE EmployeeDemographics
SET EmployeeID= 1012
WHERE firstname='Holy' AND lastname = 'Flax'

The SET statement is the new update we are adding to that role

DELETE STATEMENT 
This removes an entire row from our Table 

SYNTAX
DELETE FROM EmployeeDemographics 
WHERE EmployeeID = 1005

You have to be careful when using a delete statement, because you cannot retrive 
the information once it's deleted. 

little tricks for using DELETE statement 
firstly run a SELECT statement to ENSURE you are selecting the exact info you want to delete. 

SELECT *
FROM EmployeeDemographics 
WHERE EmployeeID= 1004

run the statement and confirm the output 

THEN replace the (SELECT *) with DELETE
i.e 

DELETE 
FROM EmployeeDemographics 
WHERE EmployeeID = 1004
