UNIONS 

Both UNION AND JOIN require combining two tables together to create one output
Difference is that a join combines based on a common column but for union , you have to select all the data from each table,
and put it in one output where all the data in each column is not separated out. 

when using UNION
Make sure the data you are selecting is the same.
Syntax for Union 

Ife we have two table EmloyeeDemographics and WarehouseEmployeeDemographics
We both contain the same number of columns with same data sets. 

SELECT *
FROM EmployeeDemographics
UNION
SELECT *
FROM WareHouseEmployeeDemographics

When we have duplicates they we be remobved using UNION . 

To have  the duplicates in our output we use UNION ALL i.e 

SELECT *
FROM EmployeeDemographics
UNION ALL 
SELECT *
FROM WareHouseEmployeeDemographics
